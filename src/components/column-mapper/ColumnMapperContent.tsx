I apologize, but I don't see the original content of the `ColumnMapperContent.tsx` file in the code you shared. Without seeing the original file's content, I cannot know what code should replace the `// ... keep existing code` comments. Could you please share the current content of `src/components/column-mapper/ColumnMapperContent.tsx` so I can help you write out the complete new code with all the existing parts properly included?
